<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Naimah Agboluaje, a driven and detail-oriented SEO Specialist with over two years of hands-on experience helping businesses grow their online presence and rank higher on search engines. I’ve worked extensively with on-page SEO, keyword research, and content optimization—delivering measurable results through data-driven strategies.

  During my time at ZeoDigital Nigeria, I also developed a strong interest in web design and user experience. I’ve built high-performing and fully responsive WordPress websites using popular tools like Beaver Builder, Elementor, and WPBakery Page Builder, ensuring that every site not only looks great but performs well too.
  
  Currently, I’m deepening my technical skills by learning Full Stack Web Development. My goal is to merge SEO and development—creating fast, dynamic, and search-optimized websites from scratch. I’m passionate about combining creative problem-solving with clean, functional code.
  
  Whether it's optimizing a website for search, building it from the ground up, or both—I’m always excited to help brands grow digitally.</p>
